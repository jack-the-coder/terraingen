## Generating Terraria-style side-scroll 2D terrain maps

...except, of course, it doesn't work!

Attempting to shoehorn ANSI terminal escape codes onto the visual generator for the first Python version doesn't work too well. I guess maybe I'll need to make a real image with textures instead, which will require a library and possibly quite a bit more work. 

As you can see, even just using a different terminal emulator results in different colors (`gnome-terminal` vs the `elpy` Python REPL in Emacs). I can change the color for the whole image, but changing the color for individual lines or especially for individual blocks doesn't work so well. 

Got an idea to fix this? Please open an issue!
